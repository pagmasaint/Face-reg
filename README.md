# Face-reg
This project demonstrates real-time face recognition capabilities using the powerful **dlib** library in Python. It leverages the deep face recognition model **`dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat`** and the facial landmark predictor **`shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`** to achieve high accuracy and good performance.\
## Features
* **Real-time Face Recognition:** Detects and recognizes faces in live video streams from a webcam or video files.
* **High Accuracy:** Utilizes dlib's deep ResNet model for robust face recognition.
* **Facial Landmarks:** Detects 68 facial landmarks for precise face localization and recognition.
* **Face Encodings:** Generates 128-dimensional face embeddings for face comparison and identification.
### Installation
Before running the code file "face_recognition_ver2", you need to prepare your own database with faces you need to recognize and download model from the drive below
